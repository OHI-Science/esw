<font size="3">The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a tool to measure the benefits and services that the ocean provides for people now and into the future. Assessments are developed with the support of local stakeholders to better understand how to sustainably balance current and future ocean use.

<font size="4"><i class="fa fa-folder-open fa-x"></i>  **The project**</h2> 
<font size="3">The application of OHI to the [South West](http://ohi-science.org/esw/about.html) aims to provide a regional baseline for marine health and to assess the impact of management policies. The project specifically coincides with development of the Marine Management Organisation's [South West Marine Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/south-west-marine-plan). Results will help inform management decision making with all data openly available.

<font size="4"><i class="fa fa-user fa-x"></i>  **The team**</h2>
<font size="3">The South West Ocean Health Index is being conducted by [researchers](http://ohi-science.org/esw/who_we_are.html) from the University of Exeter. The project began in 2018 and results are expected to be made available early 2020.
