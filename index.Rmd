<font size="3"><i class="fa fa-globe fa-x"></i>  **The Ocean Health Index (OHI)**</h2> 
<font size="3">The OHI is a tool to measure the benefits and services that the ocean provides for people now and into the future. Assessments are developed with the support of local stakeholders to better understand how to sustainably balance current and future ocean use. Discover more at [sustainable-seas.org](https://www.sustainable-seas.org/). 

<font size="3"><i class="fa fa-folder-open fa-x"></i>  **The project**</h2> 
<font size="3">The application of OHI to the South West (known as OHI+) aims to provide a regional baseline for marine health. The project coincides with development of the Marine Management Organisationâ€™s South West Marine Plan and as such we assess the relevance that a regional OHI+ assessment may have to regional planning strategy. The inclusion of multiple diverse data sets across key goals enables engagement with a broad range of marine stakeholder groups. All data and methods are open source, ensuring the process is transparent and repeatable.

<font size="3"><i class="fa fa-user fa-x"></i>  **The team**</h2>
<font size="3">The South West Ocean Health Index is being conducted by [researchers](https://www.sustainable-seas.org/team) from the University of Exeter. The project began in 2018 and results are expected to be made available Autumn 2020.
