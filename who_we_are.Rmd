**Dr Matthew Witt** (project lead and geoinformatican) - _M.J.Witt@exeter.ac.uk_

Matt is a Senior Lecturer in Natural Environment. He has 15 years’ experience in marine vertebrate ecology and conservation, computational biology, spatial ecology, ecological modelling and satellite remote sensing. His research group works on issues of human-wildlife spatio-temporal conflict and marine sustainability with a strong focus on “big data” in the marine environment. 

Matt is a member of the College of Life and Environmental Sciences and work across two of Exeter's campuses. At the Streatham Campus (Exeter) his research contributes to the Environmental Biology theme and on the Penryn Campus (Cornwall) to the Environment and Sustainability Institute.


**Dr Rachel Turner** (co-lead and social scientist) - _R.Turner@exeter.ac.uk_

Rachel is an environmental social scientist focusing on marine livelihoods, resource governance, and coastal communities. Her research focuses on understanding how socio-economic and environmental contexts drive resource-use behaviour, which has implications for management and governance systems. Her research is conducted with a focus on the dynamics of social-ecological systems and how resource users respond to change and management. 

Rachel will co-manage the project and lead on evaluation and refinement of OHI+ indicators with human dimensions. Rachel is a member of the Environment and Sustainability Institute and of the Geography department in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences.


**Dr Stephen Pikesley** (post-doctoral research associate) - _S.K.Pikesley@exeter.ac.uk_

Stephen is marine spatial ecologist with expertise in dataset integration and statistical modelling. He will be the primary modeller in the project responsible for initialising OHI+ models and applying model refinements. His research experience integrates the use of spatial ecological tools, including satellite tracking, aerial surveys, remote sensing, GIS and habitat modelling to help identify and gain insight, into marine vertebrate spatial and temporal distribution patterns and trends and, where possible, to ascertain potential areas of threat.

Stephen is a member of the Biosciences department in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences, based at the Daphne du Maurier building, Cornwall.


**Christopher Kerry** - (project support officer) - _C.Kerry@exeter.ac.uk_

Chris is an experienced GIS specialist, he routinely works with geospatial data, dataset processing and the challenges of transposing data from aspatial to spatial formats. He will be responsible for managing all datasets for the project. Kerry & Pikesley will develop multiple iterations of OHI+ outputs for varying stakeholder-informed scenarios of targets and thresholds. 

Chris is a research assistant for the Biosciences department, based in the Environment and Sustainability Institute, Cornwall.

**Owen Exeter** - (project support officer) – _O.Exeter@exeter.ac.uk_

Owen has experience in marine decision support software, GIS and stakeholder engagement. He will be responsible for planning and managing activities to elicit stakeholder input, and will liaise with other team members and stakeholder networks to enable iterative development of OHI+ indicators tailored to the southwest region. He has an interdisciplinary academic background with an MSc in Conservation Science and a BA in Politics and International Relations.

Owen is a research assistant for the Geography department, based in the Environment and Sustainability Institute, Cornwall.
