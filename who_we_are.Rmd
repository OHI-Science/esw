**Dr Matthew Witt** (project lead and geoinformatican) - _M.J.Witt@exeter.ac.uk_

Matt is a Senior Lecturer in Natural Environment. He has 15 years’ experience in marine vertebrate ecology and conservation, computational biology, spatial ecology, ecological modelling and satellite remote sensing. His research group works on issues of human-wildlife spatio-temporal conflict and marine sustainability with a strong focus on “big data” in the marine environment. 

Matt will be the project manager and is a member of the College of Life and Environmental Sciences working across two of Exeter's campuses. At the Streatham Campus (Exeter) his research contributes to the Environmental Biology theme and on the Penryn Campus (Cornwall) to the Environment and Sustainability Institute.

**Dr Rachel Turner** (project lead and social scientist) - _R.Turner@exeter.ac.uk_

Rachel is an environmental social scientist focusing on marine livelihoods, resource governance, and coastal communities. Her research focuses on understanding how socio-economic and environmental contexts drive resource-use behaviour, which has implications for management and governance systems. Her research is conducted with a focus on the dynamics of social-ecological systems and how resource users respond to change and management. 

Rachel will co-manage the project and lead on evaluation of OHI+ indicators with human dimensions. Rachel is a member of the Environment and Sustainability Institute and of the Geography department in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences.

**Dr Stephen Pikesley** (post-doctoral research associate) - _S.K.Pikesley@exeter.ac.uk_

Stephen is marine spatial ecologist with expertise in dataset integration and statistical modelling. His research experience integrates the use of spatial ecological tools, including satellite tracking, aerial surveys, remote sensing, GIS and habitat modelling to help identify and gain insight, into marine vertebrate spatial and temporal distribution patterns and trends and, where possible, to ascertain potential areas of threat.


Stephen will be the primary modeller in the project responsible for initialising OHI+ models and applying model refinements. He completed his PhD with the University of Exeter and is now a member of the Biosciences department in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences, based at the Daphne du Maurier building, Cornwall.

**Christopher Kerry** - (project officer) - _C.Kerry@exeter.ac.uk_

Chris is an experienced GIS specialist, he routinely works with geospatial data, dataset processing and the challenges of transposing data from aspatial to spatial formats. His research interests lie in using emerging technologies to study marine spatial ecology.

Chris will be responsible for managing all datasets for the project. Chris and Stephen will also develop multiple iterations of OHI+ outputs for varying stakeholder-informed scenarios of targets and thresholds.
Chris completed his MSc with the University of Exeter and is now a research assistant for the Biosciences department in the College of Life and Environmental Science based in the Environment and Sustainability Institute, Cornwall.

**Owen Exeter** - (project officer) – _O.Exeter@exeter.ac.uk_

Owen has experience in marine decision support software, GIS and stakeholder engagement. He has an interdisciplinary academic background with an MSc in Conservation Science and Policy and a BA in Politics and International Relations. He has a particular interest in spatial ecology, fisheries management and the socio-economic dynamics of fisheries in temperate waters.

Owen will be responsible for planning and managing activities to elicit stakeholder input, and will liaise with other team members and stakeholder networks to enable iterative development of OHI+ indicators tailored to the southwest region. Owen is a research assistant for the Geography department, based in the Environment and Sustainability Institute, Cornwall.
