## Assessing ocean health in Southwest England
 
There is a need to assess and track the oceans comprehensively in Southwest England by combining the best available social, economic, and environmental information. This is notably true considering the advancement of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) as a management tool across England’s coastal zones. 

MSP has become an important management tool in coastal and offshore ecosystems due to increasing human pressure placed upon these environments. MSP is a process that brings together multiple users of the ocean to make coordinated decisions about how to utilise marine resources in a sustainable manner. The Southwest Marine Plan (SWMP) offers a regional approach for MSP in English coastal waters.

Such management planning is essential to ensure improved delivery of food security, employment and ecosystem services, but requires regular, preferably independent, assessment to support the plan in delivery of stated benefits. Furthermore, a quantitative baseline understanding of ecosystem health is required from which to evaluate change through time and hence measure the relative success of differing marine policy objectives implemented within marine plans. 

Using the OHI framework, we will develop a repeatable, transparent method for measuring progress toward healthy oceans in Southwest England. The ultimate goal is to enable our community to prioritize policy decisions that affect the sustainability of our ocean resources.

We will use this website to share our work in progress, as well as the final results. Our code is available [here](https://github.com/OHI-Science/esw).

## How healthy are our oceans?

Determining ocean health requires an approach that integrates social, economic, and environmental information. The Ocean Health Index (OHI) does this by measuring progress towards widely held goals that represent key benefits and services provided by marine ecosystems. By analyzing these goals together we obtain a comprehensive picture of the state of the ecosystem.

## The Ocean Health Index project

The Ocean Health Index is a way to combine social, economic, and environmental data to measure progress towards a suite of benefits people expect healthy oceans to provide – including seafood, protection from storms, and employment. Every year since 2012, the OHI team has tracked change in global ocean health for 220 coastal nations and territories. The team is also helping build a growing network of independent groups around the world to use the OHI to understand their own oceans.
