<font size="4">**Assessing ocean health in South West England**

<font size="3">In English waters Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is currently being implemented by the UK Marine Management Organisation (MMO) through a set of regional Marine Plans. The South West Marine Plan (SWMP) offers a regional approach for MSP in busy maritime areas such as the Western Approaches, English Channel and Celtic Sea. 

MSP is essential to ensure improved delivery of food security, employment and ecosystem services, but requires regular, preferably independent, assessment to support the plan in delivery of its stated benefits. Furthermore, a baseline understanding of ecosystem health is required from which to evaluate change and measure the relative success of marine policies over time.

The application of OHI to the South West can provide this independent, repeatable and transparent assessment framework. We will tailor the OHI framework to represent the cultural, social, and ecological characteristics and priorities of South West England using the best available information and knowledge. 
As the OHI framework is transparent and repeatable over time, it can be integrated into ongoing policy initiatives to support sustainable ocean management.

<font size="4"> **Project timeline and spatial scale**

<font size="3">The project began in June 2018 and is expected to be complete by early 2020. Spatially, the project is defined by the boundaries of the Marine Management Organisation's [South West Marine Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/south-west-marine-plan). This runs from the River Severn border with Wales to the River Dart in Devon, extending offshore to the edge of the EEZ and therefore incorporating the Isles of Scilly. In total the study area includes approximately 2000 kilometres of coastline and 16,000 square kilometres of sea.

<font size="4">**Delivering OHI for the South West**

<font size="3">The OHI South West is being delivered by interdisciplinary researchers from the University of Exeter, overseen by a steering group of local experts from the fields of industry, conservation and governance.  

Based across the [Environment and Sustainability Institute](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/esi/) in Cornwall and at the [Streatham Campus](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/visit/campuses/streatham/) in Devon, you can read our team profiles [here](http://ohi-science.org/esw/who_we_are.html).
 
<font size="4"> **Future assessments**

<font size="3">This study aims to provide an initial baseline characterisation of marine health for the South West region. Once operational, OHI assessments can be updated annually or on other management time frames with less effort than its initial development. This is because all analysis is done with open source collaborative software (R, RStudio, Git, GitHub) and can be updated with the most recent data. 

There is the potential for OHI assessments to continue or expand to other regions, with the ongoing support from marine management agencies and stakeholders.
